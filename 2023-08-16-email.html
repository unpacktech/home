    <h3>Moderating an online community isn't easy. OpenAI aims to change that by leveraging GPT-4 to streamline the process. Music holds a significant place in our lives, as proven by scientists who recreated a song solely from brain signals. Additionally, Google is set to turn AI into a counselor, so fingers crossed it won't crash when I share my life story with it.</h3>
