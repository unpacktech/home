    <h3>Google has stated several times that they are using all of its resources to streamline work in one of the most important fields, healthcare. Their latest tool serves as a testament to this dedication. Guess what? Meta is very afraid of Apple, so afraid that they've completely changed their approach to the VR market. And lastly, get ready to enjoy 7 minutes of Cybertruck's full power in Baja California, Mexico. What can I say? Believe the hype.</h3>
