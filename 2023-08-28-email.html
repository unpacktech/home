    <h1 class="header">ðŸ“¦ Japan's journey gets delayed, AI may take your order, Cybertruck's latest costume</h1>
    
    <h3>I was all set to cover Japan's latest journey to space involving the XRISM satellite and its highly anticipated lunar mission, but the weather had other plans for everyone. If you're considering ordering from your favorite restaurant over the phone, AI might just be the one answering. And as we approach the end of August, Tesla seems to be getting into the Halloween spirit early, with a Cybertruck sporting a new disguise.</h3>
