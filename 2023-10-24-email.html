    <h3>Much like the witch from Snow White, but in a less evil setting, artists can safeguard their work with "poisoned" data, thanks to Nightshade. Voyager 2's journey just received a boost with NASA's latest software update, ensuring it keeps cruising through cosmic waves. And if you've ever wondered about the age of our natural satellite... Well, it turns out, it's about 40 million years older than we thought.</h3>
