    <h3>There's a chance you think I got the name wrong, but nope! "Grok" is just the cute way babies say "Grocket!" And that's what Curio is all about‚Äîrevolutionizing toys by bringing AI to playtime. On the other hand, many researchers hope to decode complex math tasks with large language models, and DeepMind appears to be in the lead. Oh, and remember Spotify's AI playlists? It is no longer a rumor! They're testing it right now. Wonder what I'd get if I typed "songs to write a newsletter."</h3>
