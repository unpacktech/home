    <h3>AI is turning Google Maps into your trusty sidekick for exploring. Finding the best nearby coffee joint or scoring some cool local events just got simpler. I never even considered the idea of strapping my phone to my wrist, but Motorola seems to think it's a pretty cool option. And here's a twist (and shout) I didn't see coming: we're getting a new Beatles song in this day and age, with a little AI magic in the mix!</h3>
