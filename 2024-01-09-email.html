    <h1 class="header">ðŸ“¦ Bad news from Peregrine, OpenAI's copyright dispute, Apple's guidelines</h1>
    
    <h3>I hate to be the one bringing the sad news, but that awesome mission we were all hyped about? Well, turns out a fuel leak is stealing its thunder. Astroboticâ€™s Peregrine wonâ€™t make it to the moon after all. The OpenAI vs. The New York Times discussion gets more intricate as the days go by, with OpenAI claiming theyâ€™re not being completely honest with their statement (though saying they aim to make things work). And, as usual, Apple is all about exclusivity; they want developers to ditch the whole VR/AR term for their fancy new Vision Pro apps.</h3>
