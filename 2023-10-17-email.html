    <h3>Xiaomi is committed to becoming a significant player in the worldwide tech landscape. Its latest software focuses on unification, which makes sense as the company aims to launch an EV soon. NASA is carefully managing its budget and has decided to save money by adjusting funds for older missions. I'm just like them! And lastly, maybe, just maybe, this week, Tesla will announce the Cybertruck deliveries. But remember, it's still a "maybe."</h3>
