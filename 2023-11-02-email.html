    <h1 class="header">üì¶ A call for transparency, Rent with AWS, Chery's new EV</h1>
    
    <h3>We're in a pretty crucial phase of AI development, where every move we make matters for its future progress. That's why a group of 70 scientists and tech leaders are calling for more openness and transparency. Good news for those wanting to run LLMs for their companies without straining their budgets: AWS offers Nvidia GPUs for rent. And, we all know that most concept cars never see the light of day, but Chery's latest one features a "fishy" twist that's got me intrigued.</h3>
