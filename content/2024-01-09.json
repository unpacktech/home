Astrobotic\u2019s Peregrine won\u2019t make it to the moon after all. The OpenAI vs. The New York Times discussion gets more intricate as the days go by, with OpenAI claiming they\u2019re not being completely honest with their statement (though saying they aim to make things work). And, as usual, Apple is all about exclusivity; they want developers to ditch the whole VR/AR term for their fancy new Vision Pro apps."
