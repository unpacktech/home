Elon Musk is dead certain that Starship's third flight will probably make it to orbit, so why not throw in some bets, right? And, as we're all hyped up for Vision Pro's arrival, here's a heads-up: we might be chilling in the Apple Store for a long time. When they say the experience is immersive, they aren't kidding."
