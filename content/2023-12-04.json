OpenAI's GPT Store needs more time after the recent craziness, and Google's Gemini, their GPT-4 competitor, is still getting its act together. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on them in 2024. Lastly, sometimes when you're in a hurry, your biggest rival turns out to be the unexpected hero. Just ask Amazon."
