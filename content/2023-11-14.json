So, if it's telling you to grab an umbrella, you might want to trust that advice. AI's fuel is data, but what if that data gets a bit scarce? Researchers shared some not-so-great news, but no worries, hopefully, there's a fix on the horizon. Lastly, if you're waiting for Apple to spice up the iPad lineup, well, that won't happen until 2024."
