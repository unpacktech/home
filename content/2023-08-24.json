Irreverent Labs is a small startup that has caught Samsung\u2019s attention, and if you\u2019re into video production you should check it out too. Lastly, Midjourney's new \"vary (region)\" feature is a lifesaver, especially for someone like me, dealing with prompt results that include unusual-looking hands."
