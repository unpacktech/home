    "description": "We're kicking off the week with some major moves from Sam Altman. You know he's got huge plans for AI, and guess what plays a big role in it? Chips. So, what's better for the main character in the industry right now than to stop relying on others (*looks at NVIDIA*) and jump into the chip-making game? Moving on to OpenAI, they're laying down the rules: no messing with political campaigns or lobbying for candidates. So, before you use their tech for that, think twice. Lastly, don't stress about automation \u2013 chances are your job won't change much, even with AI in the mix."
