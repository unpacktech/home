We've heard whispers about Vision Pro dropping in February, but how sure can we be? Well, most developers working with visionOS got the memo from Apple to fine-tune their apps. And for the creative minds out there, Midjourney just dropped Version 6! Bringing even more realistic images and finally diving into text generation. What a cool present, huh? Wishing everyone a super Merry Christmas!"
