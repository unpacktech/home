NASA thought they were in the clear after the Bennu asteroid retrieval mission, but nope! Now they're on another mission to delicately open the tiny canister without messing up the samples. And big cheers to SpaceX\u2014they're gearing up for round five with the mysterious U.S. Space Force spaceplane launch on December 28. Hopefully, they'll make it!"
