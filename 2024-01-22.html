                    <p>
                        Sam Altman is taking matters into his own hands in a move that could reshape the AI landscape. Reports suggest the CEO aims to venture into chip-making, seeking backing from major investors and Taiwan's TSMC. If successful, Altman is set to defy Nvidia's dominance.

                    <p>
                        In an effort to simplify the customization process, researchers from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI have developed proxy-tuning, an algorithm that fine-tunes language models without tweaking internal parameters.

                        From the minds of Princeton and Carnegie Mellon, Mamba has emerged to revolutionize machine learning. This Structured State Model claims to be 5x faster than Transformers, potentially outshining LLMs like ChatGPT.

                        Stability AI continues to favor smaller models, as they sometimes yield better results than older and larger ones. The company has recently introduced Stable LM 2 1.6B, whose capabilities aim to enhance developers' work in the gen-AI field.

                        Artists looking to protect their work from AI training can now use "Nightshade," a tool developed by the Glaze Project. This software alters pixels in an image, providing AI programs with a completely different outcome.

                    <p>
                        Nowadays, the fear that AI might take everyone's jobs continues to haunt plenty of workplaces. However, a study from MIT has come to ease those concerns, revealing that most of the positions at risk aren't as viable for automation as expected.

                    <p>
                        OpenAI remains firm in its stance of not allowing the use of its technology for political purposes, suspending a developer who created a chatbot to impersonate one of the US presidential candidates.

                    <p>
                        The ongoing debate on whether it is right for an artist to leverage AI for their works brings multiple opinions. Kimberley Gordon from the viral brand Selkie has received backlash for its use; nonetheless, she doesn't see it as a bad thing.

                    <p>
                        We are still at the beginning of the AI era, with many of the developments being brand new and, therefore, free to use. However, there's a possibility of this changing in the future due to the high cost of running AI models.

                        AI can transform various fields. While the technology itself won't completely overhaul the current healthcare system, it can streamline processes and enhance the patient-doctor relationship.
