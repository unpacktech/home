    <h3>The bridge between the real and virtual world is shrinking with UniSim, a universal simulator used for training in various domains such as gaming and robotics. The city that never sleeps is becoming a regular home for artificial intelligence, as experts suggest that most AI companies should establish a presence in New York. On the other hand, there's some unfortunate news: NASA's Psyche mission was delayed due to bad weather. Hopefully, the sun will shine tomorrow.</h3>
