    <h1 class="header">ðŸ“¦ Gemini sneak peek, IBM and Meta's alliance, Is AI overhyped?</h1>
    
    <h3>Yesterday, we announced that Googleâ€™s Gemini was slightly delayed. But guess what? They're reportedly giving us a glimpse at the chatbot's skills this week. Is it going to outshine GPT-4? IBM and Meta have taken matters into their own hands with the establishment of the AI Alliance, a collaboration between giants to advance open-source AI. And, plot twist, OpenAI's COO thinks the tech might be a bit overhyped, especially in the business world.</h3>
