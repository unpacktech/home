    <h3>Google keeps surprising us, and Gemini is here to shake up the AI game for good. Like, it will even make Bard better! Meta, on the other hand, promised AI in everything, and they're delivering, including an image generator with an imaginative name. And, as an Apple fan, I've always wondered why they play it safe with artificial intelligence, but who knows, maybe they're just reserving the best for last.</h3>
