                    <p>
                        Following the sudden upheaval on OpenAI's board, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has responded swiftly by recruiting Sam Altman and Greg Brockman for a pioneering AI research initiative.

                    <p>
                        Apple's Vision Pro stands out as one of the most anticipated releases of 2024. That's why the company is taking its time with the launch, shifting from January to a potential March date.

                        Over 600 OpenAI employees are calling for a board transformation after Sam Altman's abrupt exit. The request: meet their demands or face a mass migration to Altman's new initiative with Microsoft.

                        Amazon is advancing AI education with the launch of "AI Ready," which aims to train two million individuals globally in generative AI by 2025, promoting inclusivity with courses for all skill levels.
