    <h3>It's always good to give things a second shot, and after a long pause, Blue Origin has finally hit the skies with its New Shepard suborbital vehicle. Exciting times are ahead for the company. I'm a fan of funny cat videos online, but NASA just shared one that's out of this world, from Psyche's deep space journey. Oh, and who knew the Cybertruck was this versatile? Apparently, it can also be used as a boat. Talk about unexpected talents! </h3>
