    <h3>AI continues to be the main attraction, now with the New York Times explicitly forbidding its content's use for model training. Additionally, AI bots have reached such proficiency in solving CAPTCHAs that the "I'm not a robot" phrase is losing relevance. And get ready to place your bets! We've got two countries in space for a lunar race.</h3>
