    <h3>Google DeepMind just rolled out a cool way to forecast the weather, and yep, you guessed it‚Äîthere's some machine learning magic involved. So, if it's telling you to grab an umbrella, you might want to trust that advice. AI's fuel is data, but what if that data gets a bit scarce? Researchers shared some not-so-great news, but no worries, hopefully, there's a fix on the horizon. Lastly, if you're waiting for Apple to spice up the iPad lineup, well, that won't happen until 2024.</h3>
