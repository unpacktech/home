    <h3>There's no better way to kick off the year than with a launch, and India is all about it. The country's on a mission to soak up every bit of space knowledge they can. I might sound like a broken record, but seriously, AI is shaking up every scene, especially in gaming where giants like Square Enix are realizing how it can supercharge tasks. Plus, just as expected, Tesla is doing its usual magic, smashing records in a remarkable Q4 report. Curious to see what they've got up their sleeves for 2024!</h3>
