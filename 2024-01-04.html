                        A new route demands a new name. That's why after performing one of the many solar flybys needed to head toward asteroid Apophis, NASA's former OSIRIS-Rex is now OSIRIS-APEX.

                        As the adoption of EVs continues to grow, certain automakers are more ready to deal with the demand than others. It's the case with Kia, whose current EV9 electric SUV has outsold Toyota's bZ4X.
