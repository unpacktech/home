    <h1 class="header">📦 Meta introduces AudioCraft, Voyager 2 speaks again, Researchers uncover LK-99</h1>
    
    <h3>Meta’s new open-source code has me considering a career switch to music. Great news for everyone worried about Voyager’s 2 well-being, maybe we won’t have to wait until October to hear back from it. And last but not least, scientists (and I) are astonished by the recent discovery of room-temperature superconducting material called LK-99.</h3>
