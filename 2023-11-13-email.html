    <h1 class="header">üì¶ Tesla's exclusive move, Starship is all set, AI gets emotional</h1>
    
    <h3>Here's a pro tip for future Cybertruck owners: wait a bit before selling your truck, or ask Tesla first before doing it. If all goes well and the FAA gives the green light, we might get to see the Starship in action real soon! Also, if you're bummed because your ChatGPT prompts aren't hitting the mark, just let it know how much it means to you. A little emotion can do wonders.</h3>
