    <h1 class="header">📦 Nvidia's AI reign continues, Meet: Irreverent Labs, Midjourney's latest feature</h1>
    
    <h3>The numbers speak for themselves; there's no doubt that Nvidia stands as the leading contender on the AI battlefield. Irreverent Labs is a small startup that has caught Samsung’s attention, and if you’re into video production you should check it out too. Lastly, Midjourney's new "vary (region)" feature is a lifesaver, especially for someone like me, dealing with prompt results that include unusual-looking hands.</h3>
