    <h3>During the holidays, you know how everything gets postponed to January, right? Well, two big launches we were hyped about got pushed back. OpenAI's GPT Store needs more time after the recent craziness, and Google's Gemini, their GPT-4 competitor, is still getting its act together. I‚Äôll be keeping an eye on them in 2024. Lastly, sometimes when you're in a hurry, your biggest rival turns out to be the unexpected hero. Just ask Amazon.</h3>
