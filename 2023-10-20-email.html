    <h3>AI and robotics? A match made in tech heaven, and Nvidia is all over it. They've just dropped a groundbreaking AI agent that's here to teach robots some serious skills. Europe's space scene delays, setbacks, and challenges are like those unexpected rain clouds on a sunny day. However, ESA is not giving up just yet. And last but not least, Toyota's finally hopped on the NACS bandwagon.</h3>
