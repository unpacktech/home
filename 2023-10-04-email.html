    <h3>The power of generative AI is now free for you to use. Just head over to Bing Chat and unleash your creativity with DALL-E 3. Returning to the moon is a monumental feat, so every detail matters, which is why Axiom Space is partnering with Prada to create incredibly stylish spacesuits. And lastly, if that late-night work email has put you in a bad mood, you can easily express yourself with a sad face emoji, thanks to Gmail's new feature (though I wouldn't recommend it).</h3>
