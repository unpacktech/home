    <h3>I've got details from all our favorites! OpenAI is still on it, making sure its models stand for responsible AI, that's the meaning behind its recent Collective Alignment team. Microsoft's got some cool news too, Copilot's got a new Pro plan, and it's all about making work life a walk in the park. Oh, and Tesla? They're teaching Optimus to handle the boring stuff for us, like folding clothes.</h3>
