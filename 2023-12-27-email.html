    <h3>Uh oh, OpenAI and Microsoft have gotten into hot water with The New York Times, accused of using the media giant's publications to train their AI models. Sam Altman is all hyped about dropping a groundbreaking AI hardware device, and though there's little information on it, he's got an A-team backing him up (some might be ex-Apple folks). Lastly, SpaceX is gearing up to launch the X-37B space plane tomorrow‚Äîfingers crossed it all goes smoothly 'cause the January flight schedule's already packed!</h3>
