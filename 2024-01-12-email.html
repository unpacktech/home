    <h3>Yay! So, after months of figuring out how to grab bits from asteroid Bennu without messing it up, NASA finally cracked open that canister. We were just chatting about it a few days ago, but Rabbit‚Äôs R1 is surely revolutionizing gadgets with an outstanding 10,000 units sold on its first day. Lastly, ESA is on the lookout for a helping hand to launch its space innovations, and who comes to the rescue? None other than SpaceX.</h3>
