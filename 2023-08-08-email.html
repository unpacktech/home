    <h3>OpenAI has rolled out its latest tool: a web crawler. But before we get too paranoid, here's the catch: the company allows websites to limit access. In a surprising turn of events, Zoom has decided that remote working is outdated ‚Äì at least for employees living near its offices (thankfully not for me!). And continuing with the superconducting craze, it seems we must wait two weeks before determining whether it truly deserves our admiration.</h3>
