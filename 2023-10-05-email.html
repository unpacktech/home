    <h3>Get ready for a battle in the satellite field as Amazon prepares to challenge Starlink's dominance. The company's Project Kuiper launches tomorrow. Meanwhile, Japan continues its steady progress toward the moon; the SLIM spacecraft is currently enjoying its journey, with an expected landing on the lunar surface in January. And guess what? A new study suggests we should allow language models to think before speaking. Just like us, they need to meditate to stay away from saying silly things.</h3>
