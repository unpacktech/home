    <h3>Swiss students have demonstrated that you only need the right touch of engineering and aerodynamics to break a world record. Coca-Cola is taking AI to a new place: beverages. Do you dare to taste futuristic flavors? Personally, I'm all for it. Lastly, on September 14 NASA's UFO study team is discussing a few of its findings. However, don't freak out just yet; the limited number of high-quality observations makes it impossible to draw any ‚Äúextraterrestrial‚Äù conclusions.</h3>
