    <h1 class="header">📦 Voyager 2 speaks again, SpaceX's booster test, India reaches lunar orbit</h1>
    
    <h3>It is all good! After some challenging days, NASA has finally restored contact with Voyager 2, and the awkward silence has ended. SpaceX continues to delight us with an impressive test of its Super Heavy booster, but there's doubt about its capabilities. And congrats to India! The country is getting closer to joining the elite lunar landing club, I'll keep my fingers crossed for them!</h3>
