    <h3>I'm all for staying positive, but OpenAI is taking things to another level by considering every possibility ‚Äì even the wildest ones, which is why they created the Preparedness team. If you're eyeing a Model S or Model X, a new shade is now available. Certainly not the most colorful, but that's classic Tesla. Oh, and if you want to check out an asteroid up close without worrying about the end of the world, head to the Smithsonian!</h3>
