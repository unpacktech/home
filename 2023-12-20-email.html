    <h3>Many of us were just waiting for the day when Volkswagen would finally get on board with Tesla's NACS connector, and guess what? It happened before Christmas! And not just them ‚Äì Audi and Porsche are also involved. The whole AI art vs. human art debate is still going strong. People have all kinds of opinions, but the funny thing is, we humans don‚Äôt always spot the difference easily. Oh, and by the way, Microsoft dropped a cool new Copilot feature, and it's all about music!</h3>

            <p>
                NASA's infrared telescope NEOWISE is set to face challenges similar to those of Icarus, as increased solar activity disrupts its orbit, leading to its eventual descent into Earth's atmosphere in 2025.

            <p>
                A recent study suggests that while humans may struggle to distinguish AI-generated art from human creations, there is an unconscious preference for the latter, as it conveys more feelings and ideas.
