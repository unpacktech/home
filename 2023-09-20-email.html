    <h3>Toyota was caught by surprise by the ever-changing EV market; however, the automaker has a plan to show that it's not lagging behind. Elon Musk's Neuralink continues to push forward and is now looking for patients to try its revolutionary brain-computer interface. Lastly, AI is more like us than we think; they also need to take deep breaths before facing a math test.</h3>
