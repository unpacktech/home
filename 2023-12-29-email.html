    <h3>Amazon is on a mission to cut its carbon footprint by making hydrogen fuel right at its facilities. Now, loads of forklifts are jumping on the green power vibe. As I've mentioned before, humanoid robots are not just helpful; they're here to transform many industries. NASA even believes they may reach space. Also, one of the oldest newspapers in the UK is getting a tech makeover with "AI-assisted" reporters. It's out with the old and in with the new, right? And with that... I'll see you in 2024 with more tech talk!</h3>
